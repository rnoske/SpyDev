Package and Module Names:
Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the 
module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, 
all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.

Class Names:
Almost without exception, class names use the CapWords convention. 
Classes for internal use have a leading underscore in addition.
eg: CapitalizedWords():

Function Names:
Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as 
necessary to improve readability.
mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style
 (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.
eg: my_func_blub():

Constants:
Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital 
letters with underscores separating words. Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and 
TOTAL.
